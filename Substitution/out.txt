脚本是 a Lua 脚本语言 wrapper around the wxWidgets 跨平台的 C++ GUI library. It consISts of two IDE type editors that can edit, debug, and run Lua programs, an executable for running standalone WXLUA SCRIPTS, a Lua module that may be loaded using require("wx") when using the standard Lua executable, and a library for extending C++ programs with a fast, small, fully embeddable 脚本语言.

Lua IS a small 脚本语言 written in ANSI C that can load and run interpreted SCRIPTS as either files or strings. The Lua language IS fast, dynamic, and easy to learn. Lua contains a limited number of data types, mainly numbers, booleans, strings, functions, tables, and userdata. Perhaps the most powerful feature of the Lua language IS that tables can be used as either numerically indexed arrays or associative arrays that can cross-reference any variable type to any other variable type.

WXLUA adds to thIS small and elegant language nearly all of the functionality of the C++ wxWidgets 跨平台的 GUI library. ThIS includes the ability to create complex user interface dialogs, file and image manipulation, drawing, network sockets, dISplaying HTML, and printing to name a few. You can use as much or as little of wxWidgets as you like and C++ developers can trim down the size of the bindings by turning off preprocessor directives.
